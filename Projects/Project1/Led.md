# Project 1: [LED_BLINK]

This folder contains the code and schematics for [Project1].

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Connect Components:**
   - Connect the components as follows:
     - Connect the LED's longer leg (anode) to pin 12 (digital pin) on the Arduino.
     - Connect the LED's shorter leg (cathode) to a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220 ohms).
     - Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino.

2. **Upload Code:**
   - Open the `Project_Code.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino board.

3. **Observe Output:**
   - Observe the output of the project as described in the project's specific instructions.
