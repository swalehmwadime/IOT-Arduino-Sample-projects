## Software Requirements

Before getting started with the projects, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Wokwi Account:**
   - Create an account on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
   - This will allow you to simulate the Arduino projects online.

2. **Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - The Arduino IDE is essential for uploading code to physical Arduino boards.

## Getting Started with Wokwi Simulation

1. **Upload Codes to Wokwi:**
   - After creating an account on Wokwi, navigate to the platform.
   - Open the Wokwi Arduino simulator.

   - Copy the code from the respective [project folder](https://github.com/swalehmwadime/IOT-Arduino-Sample-projects/tree/main/Projects) in this repository.
   - Paste the code into the Wokwi Arduino simulator's code editor.
   - Arrange the virtual components on the Wokwi canvas as per the provided schematics.

2. **Simulate the Circuit:**
   - Press the "Run" button in Wokwi to simulate the Arduino circuit.
   - Observe the virtual components responding to the uploaded code.
   - Troubleshoot and experiment with the circuit in the simulated environment.

## Testing on Physical Arduino Board

If you have an Arduino board (recommended: Arduino Mega), follow these steps to test the projects on a physical device:

1. **Connect Arduino Board:**
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

2. **Open Arduino IDE:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

3. **Configure Arduino IDE:**
   - In Arduino IDE, go to `Tools > Board` and select the appropriate Arduino board model (e.g., Arduino Mega).

4. **Upload Code:**
   - Open the Arduino code file from the respective project folder in this repository.
   - Click the "Upload" button in Arduino IDE to upload the code to the connected Arduino board.

5. **Observe Output:**
   - Observe the connected components (LEDs, sensors, etc.) responding to the code on your physical Arduino board.




## Projects

- All the projects are located in this [folder](https://github.com/swalehmwadime/IOT-Arduino-Sample-projects/tree/main/Projects)
  
## File Structure

- Each project has three files inside it, markdown file(md), code (.ino), and the schematics
